# AddressBook-3
First try of creating a web page to gather information to be stored in the Address Book using a Java Servlet and jsp response.
This app works by first utilizing an HTML file with a form asking for Name, email and phone numer. It then goes through the servlet for processing which accesses the User class
and then gets a response back from the jsp.  All 4 files are working the way they are supposed to work.
At this point there is no styling on the html page or the return table from the jsp. This will be added at a later version.
Also, the hope is to get the servlet to call a SQL database to at first list all the entries in the address book and
Eventually, being able to add, delete and update to the address book.
